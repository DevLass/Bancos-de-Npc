<h3 align="justify"> <i> Hey there, this is my Rpg Character Bank. This is a database of non-playable characters (NPCs) for a tabletop RPG game. It is being developed entirely with pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript, bringing to life a system of random character generation through selection of information contained in a pre-defined array.</i> </h3>

<h3 align="justify"> <i>The project is not yet complete. Some of the features I am planning to add include: additional languages (currently it is only in Portuguese), a wider variety of characters, functional likes and dislikes, more in-depth RPG information, and much more.</i> </h3>

<h3 align="justify"> <i>This simple yet efficient functionality will make the creation of NPCs during game sessions much more easier and challenging for the players. I can't wait to see this project completed and in action during my next RPG game session.</i> </h3>

<h3 align="justify"> <i>If you want to add characters just increase the array and change the variable random number</i> </h3>
